# SpotifyGeneratePlaylist
This is my code used for the [SpotifyGeneratePlaylist project by TheComeUpCode](https://github.com/TheComeUpCode/SpotifyGeneratePlaylist)

"A simple script that takes your liked videos on YouTube, and generates a Spotify playlist based on the song in your liked videos"

## Technologies
- YouTube Data API v3
- Spotify Web API
- Requests Library v 2.22.0
- Youtube_dl v 2020.01.24

## Setup
Setup instructions can be found at the repository linked above

## ToDo
- I'd like to have the option of a particular YouTube playlist being turned to a Spotify playlist, not just liked videos
